\chapter{Heat simulations}
\label{sec:heatsims}
This appendix will include the simulation Joanna did on the temperature profile of a heating point in a layer of Tungsten. The goal is to show that the Tungsten is locally heated above its melting point, ergo it cannot be used. I am not certain if I should include the results for the slanted shape where it does \textit{not} melt.
