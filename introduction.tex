In novel free electron laser designs (so-called photonic free-electron lasers), electrons stream through a photonic crystal. Interaction of the electrons with a Bloch eigenmode of the photonic crystal results in bunching of the electrons. This bunching results in coherent amplification of the Bloch eigenmode \cite{Denis}.
The bunching, and therefore the gain of the laser, strongly depends on the properties of the electron beam(s).
This report describes a sensor system that is able to measure the transverse location and charge density of the electron beam and consequently will be used to characterize the alignment of the electron beam used in a photonic free-electron laser.

%, a high gain and continuous tuning have been presented. \cite{Denis} Such systems require a high charge-density quasi-continuous electron beam to be shot through a photonic crystal (PC). 
%In order to achieve a good approximation of the designs and simulations presented in these works, the electron beam must be localized and any deviation from the simulations in this regime must be eliminated up to small deviations (See appendix \ref{sec:alesresults}). However, the set-up has no method of locating the electron beam built-in.

\section{The photonic Free Electron Laser}
%CFEL --> problems with high power beams --> pFEL multiple beams --> diagnostic is missing --> This report describes solution
Cherenkov Free Electron Lasers (CFEL's) have been a field of study for a long time \red{insert references here}. However, generally the output power is limited due to the nature of the Cherenkov radiation.
In order to increase the power radiated, the electron beam current must be increased. This leads to an increase in necessary measures to be taken in order to stop the beam from diverging and destroying the medium.
\red{insert formula on beam divergence to show this}

In order to overcome these problems, the photonic Free-Electron laser was developed. Here, the homogeneous medium is replaced by a photonic crystal, allowing multiple electron beams to contribute to a single-mode output power \cite{DenisMultiBeam}.
The merits of the photonic crystal as a Cherenkov medium have been shown in simulations, possibly allowing a continuously tunable source with high output power.
A proof-of-principle set-up has been built \cite{Denis} but no output was detected. In this set-up, the frequency was expected to be 16\,GHz. The photonic crystal period was 4.2\,mm. The electron beam was accelerated from 10\,kV up to 15\,kV and the current was measured to be around 1\,A.

\section{Troubleshooting}
It is believed that the lack of output is due to a misalignment of the electron beam, photonic crystal axis and the magnetic field direction.

% pFEL is praktisch minder
However, methods to determine the transverse position of an electron beam are not readily in place but must be added to the pFEL set-up. 
There are a number of methods to detect the position of an electron beam.

\paragraph{Optical methods}
In certain materials, the kinetic energy of the electrons is absorbed and converted to optical photons. \red{citation needed} These can then be imaged and thus the beam profile can be determined. A well known example of a material that has this property is phosphor. It is used to build the CRT-type screens where electrons are scanned over a glass surface that is coated with phosphor.
Another, more sturdy material that has this property is a Cerium-doped YAG crystal (Ce:YAG). \red{citation needed}
However, although the kinetic energy is not very high in this system (15\,keV), the current is relatively high at up to \SI{2}{\ampere}. This current is spread over a beam with a radius of \mm{1}, giving the surface it hits a power density of around $10\,\text{kW\,mm}^{-1}$
This is significantly more than any of the optical methods are made for. The surface melts and partly evaporates shortly after exposure to this electron beam. 
The effects can be seen in figure \ref{fig:brokenyag}. Shown are the remains of a Ce:YAG screen with a layer of titanium on it to mirror the cathode's glow. The metal has been molten over a large part of the surface and the YAG crystal has clearly visible damage where the beam hit.

At the top the metal is thought to have molten and formed a liquid drop. At the center a colourful corona is visible and a circular hole can clearly be distinguished.}

\end{figure}

Changing the energy deposited by the beam would require either a shorter pulse time, a lower beam current (charge density) or a lower acceleration potential.
Due to the nature of the set-up, the pulse time can not be made shorter than \SI{1}{\micro\second} which does not solve the problem. Changing the charge density or the acceleration potential requires a different magnetic field. 
This is another possible source of errors in the electron beam path as this may oscillate or spiral if the magnetic field is set wrongly. Therefore changing the magnetic field is not preferable.
Since this is not possible, the optical measurements are not applicable for this measurement.

\paragraph{Electrical methods}
Another method to locate an electron beam is to use a faraday cup. This is a cylinder with one open end and a ``target'' in the center. The target is connected to electrical ground via a current measurement device. 
The electron beam hits the target and the current is measured. If the cup consists of multiple segments, the current profile over different segments directly translates to a beam profile. \red{citation needed}
This enables a faraday cup to be used as a beam profile measurement device.
However, our simulations (see appendix \ref{sec:heatsims}) have shown that for a straight impact angle, the surface is heated up to above the melting point of any metal\footnote{except Adamantium and Mithril which are not readily available at this time.}.

Another option is a beam position monitor (BPM). This is a device generally used for bunched ion or electron beams. It consists of a set of plates parallel to the beam path. As the beam bunches induce a voltage on the plates, the voltage readout gives information on the center-of-charge of the beam and its total charge density.

Although this is a viable method for measuring high-power electron beams, it is generally only used for bunched beams, where the pFEL relies on a quasi-static beam. \red{citation needed}.

In this report, the design of a specialized type of BPM is explained
By utilizing the principles of a set of capacitive pick-up electrodes, the beam is not intercepted. This way the high energy of the electron beam is not turned to destructive heat and can in future designs even still be utilized in the laser system.
The normal problems of capacitive pick-up electrodes are overcome by a DC-coupling and thus the electrode is also usable for a quasi-DC beam.
