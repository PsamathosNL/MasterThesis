\chapter{Simulations on Location errors}
\label{sec:alesresults}
This appendix will present two simulations that Ale did, one with a misaligned electron beam (slightly displaced) and one with a tilted magnetic field.
The goal here is to show that the simulations give non-physical results if the electron beam is close to a perfect electrical conductor.
