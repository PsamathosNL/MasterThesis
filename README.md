# MasterThesis
My Master Thesis. Copyrighted and mine. No part of this may be copied nor used without my express written consent.

To build:
The files essay_1.tex and bibliography.bib must be placed in one folder while the rest of the files are in a "Chapters" subfolder. Then, the file essay_1.tex must be compiled using a LaTeX distribution.
There should also be a "Pictures" subfolder with all pictures in it but these have been omitted in the repository. Only text is saved here.
